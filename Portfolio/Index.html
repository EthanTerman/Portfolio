        <img src="images/ethan.jpg" alt="cool looking guy" class="img" width="300">
        <P>My name is Ethan, I was born in Minneapolis MN. I've always loved anything with design or 
            customization. What got me 
            into graphic design was 
            actually Formula 1 and NASCAR, the car with the coolest paint scheme and most interesting logos covering it, I'd cheer for. From there it brought me down the rabbit hole of design. Im a Graduate of Mahtomedi 
            Highschool and im currently in my third year as student of the University of Wisconsin Eau 
            Claire. 
            </P>
